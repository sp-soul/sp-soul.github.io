    <p>
      Having been at Octopus Energy since its formation in 2015, I built and

      standard of energy supplier, and make renewable energy more affordable for
      everyone. The teams feature Front-end and Back-end web development,
      Mobile, Design, Product, and Data Visualisation. Over these years, I have
      learned how to manage across disciplines, timezones, and various team
      sizes, and discovered my love for it as a job.
