		<h3><a href="https://octopus.energy">Octopus Energy</a> (December 2015 - Present)</h3>
		<p>I built and lead the Global Front-end department at Octopus Energy, crafting sites and internal tools, building new products and campaigns, and expanding into other countries. Our aim is to combat climate change, use technology to build a better standard of energy supplier, and make renewable energy more affordable for everyone. In May 2020, Octopus Energy became the 15th UK tech <strong>“unicorn”</strong> after achieving a valuation of <a href="https://octopus.energy/blog/octopus-energy-achieves-unicorn-status-investment-origin-energy/">over &pound;1 billion</a>. A huge passion of mine at Octopus is <strong>web accessibility</strong>; ensuring we have a usable, enjoyable experience for everyone regardless of their disability or access needs. If you’re interested, I've written a book about it, <a href="https://inclusive.guide">which you can learn more about here</a>.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://octopus.energy/tracker">Octopus Tracker</a></h4>
			<p>I created the front-end as we created and launched the <strong>industry’s first</strong> tracker tariff, where the price changes every day in line with the wholesale cost of energy. It provides customers with a detailed cost breakdown, including the margin made by the company. The front-end build used <strong>HTML5 canvas</strong> for handling the visualisation of data.</p>

		<h3><a href="https://inclusive.guide">Practical Web Inclusion and Accessibility</a></h3>
		<p>My first book, published with <a href="https://apress.com">Apress</a>, is about web accessibility.

Going beyond advice tailored solely for developers, this book offers potential improvements for designers, developers, user experience professionals, QA and testers, so that everyone involved in building a website can benefit.</p>
